  description: `Hi, I am Yash Shukla, a passionate and driven 3rd-year B.Tech student specializing in Computer Science and Engineering with a focus on Cybersecurity and Privacy at DIT University.
  
  I am a quick learner with a self-motivated attitude, always eager to explore new technologies and sharpen my problem-solving skills. I enjoy building real-world projects, contributing to collaborative teams, and diving deep into both core computer science and cutting-edge web development.

  My strength lies in JavaScript and the full web development stack, including technologies like Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and RESTful APIs. I am also actively exploring areas like cybersecurity, cloud integrations, and system design, while regularly improving my DSA skills on platforms like LeetCode.

  Whether it's backend development, security-focused projects, or full-stack apps, I love bringing ideas to life through code and making the web more open, secure, and impactful.

  I am actively seeking internship or placement opportunities where I can apply my skills, contribute meaningfully, and continue growing as a software engineer.`,
